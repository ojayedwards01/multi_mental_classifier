# A Multiclass Machine Learning Approach for Mental Health and Cyberbullying Identification

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper "A Multiclass Machine Learning Approach for Mental Health and Cyberbullying Identification on Social Media," submitted to ACM EAAMO '25.

The entire methodology, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, is contained within the main Jupyter Notebook: `mbd-research-mayv7.ipynb`.

## Installation

To run the notebook, first clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/ojayedwards01/multi_mental_classifier.git](https://github.com/ojayedwards01/multi_mental_classifier.git)
cd multi_mental_classifier

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Reproduce the Results

1.  Open the `mbd-research-mayv7.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2.  Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will handle NLTK downloads, data augmentation, model training, and will generate the figures presented in the paper.
